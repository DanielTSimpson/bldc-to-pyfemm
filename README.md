# bldc-to-pyfemm
A script to interface a DXF of a partial BLDC motor profile into FEMM using pyfemm.
Current scope is to get the torque from a rotor given a set of instantaneous phase currents.
DXF naming convention is _"numberslots_numberpoles_numberwindings_statorID_statorBase_wiredia_toothheight_toothoverhang_toothwidth_magnetwidth_magnetthk_magnetstatorgap_rotorthk".dxf_
